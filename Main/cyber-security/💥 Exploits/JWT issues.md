(For more reading check out https://auth0.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-json-web-token-libraries/)

There is a support for the `None` algorithm, thatâ€™s mainly used for testing.

To exploit this vulnerability, you have to remove the signature and change the algorithm to `None`.

To analyze a web token online you can use [this site](https://jwt.io/)


Now, you have to make a token that looks something like this:

eyJhbGciOiJOb25lIiwidHlwIjoiSldTIn0.eyJsb2dpbiI6ImFkbWluIiwiaWF0IjoiMTY5MDgwMTAxNyJ9.
```

We can see that the signature field is empty.
