To convert a number to a negative number, we invert the bits, and add one. So `0011` becomes `1100 + 0001` = `1101`. This seems complicated, why is this useful? Well itâ€™s simple, this makes it so we can use the same arithmetic operations on negative numbers as on positive ones. This is called the __twos compliment__
