File include vulns can be dangerous for several reasons, they can allow an attacker to read local files, and if that wasnâ€™t enough, also sometimes interpret and execute remote or local php files, leading to an __RCE__.

```ad-note
PHP by default turns this off with: `allow_url_include` 
```

This can a lot of times be tested by injecting a a special character (for example a _quote_).

The problem usually occurs in: `require`, `require_once`, `include` or `include_once`.
