# Threat Intelligence

__Def__: Threat Intelligence is the analysis of data and information using tools and techniques to generate meaningful patterns on how to mitigate against potential risks associated with existing or emerging threats targeting organisations, industries, sectors or governments.

To mitigate against risks, we can start by asking a few simple questions.
- Who's attacking you?
- What is their motivation?
- What are their capabilities?
- What artefacts and indicators of compromize should you look for?
